            <dd>The main structure of the graph is the big colorful circle. With clear label, users can learn how many millions of years are different ages away from the present day. Additionally, after ecery period, the lend thickness will increase, so user won’t confused which point to start. (the thinner the land is, the early is the period.) For every small period, there is different landscapes and representative animals or plants. You can also learn when are mass extinction events happened and during what ages.
