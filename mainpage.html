  Hold on to your seats. This one is really bad. In this infographic of “How Baby Boomers Describe Themselves”, there are so many problems, that I don’t know where to begin.

Let’s start off by saying that the percentages given do not add up to 100%. Does this mean that the data was incorrectly calculated? Or does it mean that each person was allowed to describe themselves with more than one trait? We will never know.

Also, no matter how you look at the color areas of the chart, the area or vertical space of the colors does not seem to correspond with the numbers presented on the right.

Having the colors filling up the shape of a person does not help the situation. Because a novel shape will have varying widths from bottom to top. This makes it very hard to know what percentage each color represents.

Finally, what is the value for this particular data set of having the shape be a walking person?

As a general rule, maybe we shouldn’t use a strange shape to represent these values. It only serves to confuse and obscure the story the data is trying to tell.
